Github is a very easy way to create a personal website, there are thousands of repositories with templates. 
The template for this site is the [minimal mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/). I found it when checking out <a href="https://philosophysics.github.io/site//"> the website of Gabriele di Ubaldo</a>, and I forked it from there. Apparently he also forked it from the website of another physicist, see credits in his website.
