## Neural network approximation theory
The goal is to understand which is the family of functions which are approximable without curse of dimensionality.

This work has been my "semester paper" during my degree at ETH.
In this work we develop a new machinery to study the capacity of neural networks to approximate high-dimensional functions without suffering from the curse of dimensionality.
We then use our machinery to prove that the solutions of certain easy PDEs are arbitrarily approximable without the curse of dimensionality.
