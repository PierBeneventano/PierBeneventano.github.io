During my studies at <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/" class="links">ETH Zurich</a> and now during my PhD at <a href="https://orfe.princeton.edu/home" class="links">Princeton</a> I have been and will be involved in teaching. 


# ETH Zurich 
## <a href="http://vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=136107&semkez=2020S&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en" class="links">Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations</a>, Spring 2020
- *Master* in Physics, Data Science, Computational Biology. Computational Science and Engineering Bachelor.
- I taught at the exercise classes and corrected the homeworks (in C++).
- *Contents:* Derivation, properties, and implementation of fundamental numerical methods for a few key partial differential equations: convection-diffusion, heat equation, wave equation, conservation laws. Implementation in C++ based on a finite element library.


## <a href="http://vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=132349&semkez=2019W&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en" class="links">Computational Methods for Engineering Applications</a>, Fall 2019
- Mechanical Engineering Bachelor, third year.
- I taught at the exercise classes (also explaining part of the theory) and corrected the homeworks (in C++).
- *Contents:* introduction to the numerical methods for the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations that play a central role in engineering applications. Both basic theoretical concepts and implementation techniques necessary to understand and master the methods will be addressed.


## Translator and Proofreader, Summer 2019
As part of a project at <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/" class="links">ETH Zurich</a>, I was part of translation team and I have been selected as the final proofreader of a Calculus book (German to Italian).

# Previously
- Hold classes on mathematics for highschool olympiads
- Tutored a number of students from high school to advanced university courses in Master and College level Statistics, Operations Research, Algorithms, College-level Mathematics, etc.
