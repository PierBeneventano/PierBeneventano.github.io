During my studies at <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/" class="links">ETH Zurich</a> and now during my PhD at <a href="https://orfe.princeton.edu/home" class="links">Princeton</a> I have been and will be involved in teaching. 


## ETH Zurich <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/" class="links">ETH Zurich</a>

# Spring 2019
- - <a href="http://vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=136107&semkez=2020S&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en" class="links">Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations</a>, *Master level*, Offered in various masters: Physics, Data Science, Computational Biology; and also in the Computational Science and Engineering Bachelor.

I taught at the exercise classes and corrected the homeworks (in C++).

*Contents:* Derivation, properties, and implementation of fundamental numerical methods for a few key partial differential equations: convection-diffusion, heat equation, wave equation, conservation laws. Implementation in C++ based on a finite element library.

# Fall 2019
- <a href="http://vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=132349&semkez=2019W&ansicht=KATALOGDATEN&lang=en" class="links">Computational Methods for Engineering Applications</a>, Mechanical Engineering Bachelor, third year.

I taught at the exercise classes (also explaining part of the theory) and corrected the homeworks (in C++).

*Contents:* introduction to the numerical methods for the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations that play a central role in engineering applications. Both basic theoretical concepts and implementation techniques necessary to understand and master the methods will be addressed.

# Summer 2019
- As part of a project at <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/" class="links">ETH Zurich</a>, I was part of translation team and I have been selected as the final proofreader of a Calculus book (German to Italian).

# Previously
- Tutored a number of students from high school to advanced university courses in Master and College level Statistics, Operations Research, Algorithms, College-level Mathematics, etc.
