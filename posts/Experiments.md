# Experiments with NNs

I'm a mathematician working in machine learning and as such I like theory and I want to work on that. 
The truth is, I'd like to develop the theory of something that has paractical use, and the whole point of developing the theory is understanding why it works in practice, so

**What theory are you gonna to develop if you don't know what you're playing with?**

For this reason I got experiments, they are necessary to understand what statement and theorem may work, before blindly trying to prove it. 

For this I'm indebt with <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=fymm-XQAAAAJ&hl=en" class="links">Prof. Arora</a> and with my friend <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=fymm-XQAAAAJ&hl=en" class="links">Samy Jelassi</a> that conviced me I had to learn how to do it.
